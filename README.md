# PixQuotes
The all new way to generate text using methods which have existed for decades.


# What is this?

Pix Quotes is my attempt to recreate Markov Chain text generators. Now you too can generate up to 200 chains (soon to be unlimited) of completely procedural text. That's right, the outputs provided by this program are completely random. It is recommended you get lots of text as an input if you want to use the word chains.

# How do I use this

0) Get java 8 you silly person.

1) Run java -jar PixQuotes.jar in a console.

2) Follow the directions provided

3) Use > to output the results to a file


# What features will you add in the future?

I have nothing really planned

If you want the output to be placed in a file then pipe it into one from the console.
