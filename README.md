# PixQuotes
The all new way to generate text using methods which have existed for decades.


# What is this?

Pix Quotes is my attempt to recreate Markov Chain text generators. Now you too can generate infinite chains of completely procedural text. That's right, the outputs provided by this program are completely random*. It is recommended you get lots of text as an input if you want to use the word chains. Oh, don't get too much text though because chain generation time is equal to chains * length of input, so there's that. I don't know if it counts as big O of (n^2) but it might as well.

# How do I use this

0) Get java 8 or maybe 7 or above.

1) Run java -jar PixQuotes.jar in a console.

2) Follow the directions provided.


# What features will you add in the future?

I have nothing really planned

If you want the output to be placed in a file then pipe it into one from the console.
